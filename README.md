# JOptionPane-dialog-box
Write a Java class that calculate the tax, tip, and total on a restaurant bill. The program should use a JOptionPane dialog box to ask the user to enter the charge for the meal. Your program should have the followings:  1) Declare 2 constant variables: TAX_RATE and TIP_PERCENT, initialize the TAX_RATE as 7% and TIP_PERCENT as 15%,  2) Declare 4 double variables: mealCharge, tax, tip, and total,  3) Declare a String variable input to hold the user input,  4) Display a message (see attached image, the top image) to ask the user enter the charge of the meal and assign the user input to the String variable input,  5) Convert the String input variable to a double and assign to the mealChargevariable,  6) Calculate the tax as mealCharge multiply the TAX_RATE,  7) Calculate the tip as mealCharge multiply the TIP_PERCENT,  8) Calculate the total as the summation of mealCharge, tax, and tip,  9) Display the results in the JOptionPane dialog box (see attached image, the bottom image). You can display more than 2 decimal places in your output.
